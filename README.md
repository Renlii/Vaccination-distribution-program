# Vaccination-distribution-program

For my Database Systems class, I developed a database (and associated application) to manage the COVID vaccination dis-
tribution process in Quebec.

Step by step, I designed a schema, created a database using DB2, populated the database with data,
maintained, queried and updated the data, developed application programs, and implemented a user-friendly interface.
